You need to have installed coffee-script in order to compile it. You can
install it with the following command: sudo npm install -g coffee-script.
After this, run the install.rb script to install the script in the Amarok
directory. You may have a different Amarok directory, so take a look at the
install.rb script and modify the SCRIPT_PATH constant at your own needs.

Use it at your own risk :)
